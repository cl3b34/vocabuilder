#summary Thesis weblog

= Thesis work on Vocabuilder =

I'm doing several improvements on Vocabuilder as part of my final Thesis work at Haaga-Helia.

Here you can find a short list of what is planned, the progress and an account of the time spent per task.

  * Fix a performance Issue on the RMS subsystem (issue 3)
  	* week 15: 30h
  		* Modify the internal file format improving flexibility and performance (issue 5)
  	* week 16: 30h 
  		* Create a new model for the storage (m2), updating single records
  	* week 17: 35h 
  		* Create a new model for the storage (m3), saving the whole list in a single record
  	* week 18: 30h 
  		* Create Unit tests, fix bugs and validate the performance
  	* week 19: 15h 
  		* Fix bugs and validate the performance in the test hand set (Nokia E50)
  		* Update the web site and create this page
  	* week 20: 10h 
  		* Create a beta version with m3 as storage mechanism
  		* Create unit tests and fix bugs
  		* Improve the user interface
  			# The 'statistics' page should have an 'exit' button
 
  * Include support for multiple lists of words (read / delete). Should be possible to load for study or delete permanently any of the lists available in the handset, but the default.
  	* week 21: 5h
  		* Use the list name as the recordStore name  		
  		* Change the UI to allow the selection and loading of any available list
  		* Divide the long lists in smaller ones
  		* Recompile the demo applications with the lists divided in smaller ones (will break backward compatibility)
  	
  * Create 'preferences' for the application
  	# Show words in random or sequential order
  	# Show first side 1 or side 2 of the card
  * Create a website where the user can create his own lists of words
  	# The lists can be private or public
  	# Let the user load his own lists and public lists via HTTP to the mobile
   * Write a thesis document (min 25 pages)
