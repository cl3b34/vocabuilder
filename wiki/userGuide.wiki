#summary Very short user guide

= User Guide =

The application have a list of words with its translation in another language.
A combination of a word and its translation makes up a 'virtual flash card'.

The words are displayed randomly, you can see a word (one side of the card), turn the 'card' to see the translation and mark it as 'done' if you already know the word or if you don't know it yet, mark it as 'wrong'. 

Words marked as 'done' are not displayed anymore, so that you may focus on new or yet to memorize words.

Every time you exit the application (by pressing exit) it displays a 'statistics' screen with the amount of words you know, time spent studying, etc.
That screen will disappear automatically after a few seconds.

When you mark all words as 'done' the application will ask if you want to start over, so you can study the whole list again.

The application saves its own state between sessions, that way, you are able to use it for studying even in very short periods (say in the bus from home to work).
