#summary From where I got these lists of words

= About the default lists of words =

The default lists of words that ship with the application came from [wakefield.org http://welcometowakefield.org.uk/translations/].

When I contacted the site webmaster to know if I could redistribute it in a open source software, I was told that they were in the public domain and that he had machine-generated these lists using an ancient English -> Esperanto -> 'target language' translator... The original application apparently is no longer available.
