#summary Getting started developing in Vocabuilder

= Setting up your working environment =

You can get the Vocabuilder sources at: 

http://code.google.com/p/vocabuilder/source/checkout 

You will need Subversion for downloading it, I recommend the use of a GUI client called tortoise:

When you download Vocabuilder you get an Eclipse project. 

http://www.eclipse.org

You will also need to install Sun's Wireless tool Kit (WTK):

And I recommend you also install EclipseME to make the integration between WTK and Eclipse easier:

Unit testing is done using J2MEunit (http://j2meunit.sourceforge.net/), but you shouldn't need to install anything to get that. 
The libraries are already included in the project.
