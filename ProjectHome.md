# Learn a new Language with Vocabuilder #

**Vocabuilder** is a mobile application designed to help you learn new languages.

It helps you learn new words and improve your vocabulary.

## Small update: version 1.7.10 Finnish-English ##
Following a user request I made the wordlists smaller to facilitate learning.
Now the lists for this language have a maximum of 50 words each.

Note that I also removed the EN->FI lists, leaving only FI->EN. If you use the EN-FI lists, please contact me and I will add then back.

If you have improvement ideas that you would like to see implemented, contact me at: cl3b34 |at| gmail |dot| com.

Or simply submit a issue in the issues section.


## Language support ##

Several languages are supported, have a look at the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/vocabuilder/downloads/list) section for more details.
